🖼️ Face Alignment Using CNNs
📌 Description:
This project implements a CNN-based face alignment model for accurately detecting facial landmarks (eyes, nose, lips). The approach enhances real-time face recognition, augmented reality, and facial tracking applications.

📌 Features:
✅ Deep Learning-based facial landmark detection
✅ Trained CNN for feature extraction & alignment
✅ Preprocessing techniques for robust model performance
✅ Optimized for real-time applications

📌 Tech Stack:

Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow, PyTorch
Deep Learning (CNNs, Facial Landmark Detection)
Data Preprocessing (Normalization, PCA, Image Augmentation)
Jupyter Notebook for visualization

📌 Results & Performance:

Improved landmark detection accuracy by 7%
Enhanced real-time face tracking with OpenCV
Tested on benchmark facial datasets
